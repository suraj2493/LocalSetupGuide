Introduction

Postman is a standalone software testing API (Application Programming Interface) platform to build, test, design, modify, and document APIs. 
It is a simple Graphic User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requests and responses.
While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write any HTTP client network code. 
Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact with the API.
In this tool, nearly any functionality that any developer may need is embedded. This tool has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and convert the API to code for languages like JavaScript and Python.
