**Introduction**
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

**Install Docker for Windows**

  1.Double-click Docker for Windows Installer.exe to run the installer.

  2.If you haven’t already downloaded the installer (Docker for Windows Installer.exe), you can get it from download.docker.com. It typically downloads to your Downloads folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

  3.Follow the install wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install.

  4.You will be asked to authorize Docker.app with your system password during the install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs.

  5.Click Finish on the setup complete dialog to launch Docker.

**Start Docker for Windows**

1.Docker will not start automatically. To start it, search for Docker, select the app in the search results, and click it (or hit Return).

2.When the whale in the status bar stays steady, Docker is up-and-running, and accessible from any terminal window.

3.If the whale is hidden in the Notifications area, click the up arrow on the taskbar to show it.

4.If you just installed the app, you also get a popup success message with suggested next steps.

5.When initialization is complete, select About Docker from the notification area icon to verify that you have the latest version.You are up and running with Docker for Windows.
